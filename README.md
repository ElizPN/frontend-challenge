# Countdown App

# Features
- Implemented search in input
- Showing coundown for every futute holiday
- Date and name are persisted between page reloads
- Added responsivness for mobeile and iPad screen
- Added unit test
- Added GitHub workflow for automatic deployment


## Future improvments

- Handle different time zones.
- Add holidays for next year.
- When the cursor is focused in the input, show a dropdown list with all holidays. Currently, we have to search for the particular holiday.
- Besides unit tests, it would be nice to add end-to-end tests.
- Improve responsivnes.
- Finish the CI/CD pipeline. I have created a YAML file with all necessary steps. The pipeline is breaking at the last step. I assume there is an access issue, adding name and email should fix it.
- Encapsulate countdown logic.
